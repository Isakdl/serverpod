# Serverpod

[Serverpod](https://serverpod.dev) is a next-generation app and web server, built for the Flutter community. It allows you to write your server-side code in Dart, automatically generate your APIs, and hook up your database with minimal effort. Serverpod is open-source, and you can host your server anywhere.

## Features

TODO: write a feature list, and include some animation before we publish it as an extension...

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

You need the serverpod CLI installed in your path for this extension to work. Run the following command in your terminal to install it:

`dart pub global activate serverpod_cli`

Note: The serverpod CLI requires both [dart and flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install.) to be installed.


## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.
